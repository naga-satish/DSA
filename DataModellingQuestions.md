## Basic Questions
##### 1. What is data modeling?

##### 2.What are the different types of data models?

##### 3. What are the advantages of using a star schema in data modeling?

##### 4. What is normalization, and why is it important?
    Normalisation is a process of reducing data redudency. It is important because 
    1. It reduces size of data stored on disk.
    2. It helps us to handle insertion, updatation and deletion anamoly.

## Slowly Changing Dimensions
##### 1. What is a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)?
    A Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) in data warehousing addresses how to manage changes in dimension attributes over 
    time. It ensures historical data and changes are tracked for better analysis. 
    
    There are various SCD types:
        1: Overwrites old data with new.
        2: Creates new records for changes, preserving history. (add new row)
        3: Adds new columns for limited history tracking.
        4: Stores historical data in separate tables.
        6: Combines Types 1, 2, and 3.

##### 2. Why are SCDs important in data warehousing?
    SCDs are important in data warehousing because they manage and track changes in dimension data over time, 
    ensuring accurate historical and current analysis.

##### 3. Can you explain SCD Type 1 and provide an example of when it might be used?
    SCD Type 1 involves handling changes in dimension data by simply overwriting the existing data with new 
    values, with no historical data preserved. This method is used when it is unnecessary to retain previous 
    values or when changes are corrections rather than true historical modifications. For example, if a 
    customer's phone number is updated due to a correction, using SCD Type 1 would replace the old number 
    with the new one directly. This approach is ideal when data accuracy and consistency take precedence 
    over maintaining a history of changes, such as fixing errors in records or updating non-critical attributes.

##### 4. What is SCD Type 2, and how does it maintain historical data?
    SCD Type 2 maintains historical data by creating a new record in the dimension table for each change in 
    data attributes, thereby preserving all past states. This approach allows multiple records to exist for 
    a single entity, each with start and end dates or other markers to indicate its validity period. 
    For instance, if a customer relocates, a new row with the updated address and a new version or effective 
    date is added, while the previous address record remains unchanged. This method ensures a complete 
    historical view, facilitating analysis of how dimension attributes have evolved over time.

##### 5. Explain SCD Type 3 and when you would choose this approach.
    SCD Type 3 tracks changes by adding new columns to store previous values of dimension attributes,
    allowing for limited historical insight. This method typically supports retaining the immediate past 
    state along with the current state, making it useful for scenarios where understanding the impact of a 
    recent change is more important than a full historical record. This approach is chosen when simplicity 
    is key, and only a small amount of historical data needs to be analyzed, such as comparing a customer's 
    loyalty status before and after a recent change ("Gold" to "Platinum"), without requiring multiple 
    historical records.

### Implementation and Design
##### 6. How would you implement an SCD Type 2 in a SQL-based data warehouse?
    Implementing an SCD Type 2 in a SQL-based data warehouse involves several steps to ensure that each change in 
    dimension data creates a new record while preserving historical data. Here's a general approach:
    
    1. Structure Your Table
    2. Create a Staging Table
    3. Identify Updated Records
    4. Expire Old Records
    5. Insert New Records

##### 7. What are some challenges you might encounter with SCDs, and how would you address them?
    Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) can present several challenges. 
    Here are some common issues along with strategies to address them:
    
    1. Data Volume and Performance
    2. Complexity in Change Tracking
    3. Historical Data Management
    4. Data Consistency and Integrity
    5. Business Logic Complexity
    6. Storage Costs  
    7. Interdependency with Other Systems
    
##### 8. How do you decide which SCD type to use for a particular dimension?
    To decide on the appropriate SCD type for a dimension, consider the organization's need for historical tracking,
    data volume impact, and analytical requirements. If maintaining all historical changes is crucial, SCD Type 2 is
    suited for comprehensive history tracking, despite its storage and maintenance complexity. For simple overwrite 
    scenarios where history isn’t needed, SCD Type 1 is appropriate. Use SCD Type 3 when limited historical insight,
    such as comparing current and previous states, suffices. Engage with stakeholders to understand business rules 
    and compliance needs, and anticipate future changes to choose a solution aligning technical feasibility with 
    business goals.
